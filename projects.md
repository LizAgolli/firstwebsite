# Completed Work

*Evolve Part of Evolve and Resequence Experiment*

Artificially selected upon sexual size dimorphism over fifteen generations.

# Current Research Projects

*Resequence Part*

Comparing the genomes of resulting lines to each other and those of the initial population using UIC's HPC.

*Characterizing Isogenized Lines*

Characterizing developmental characteristics of the final populations including:

 - sexual size dimorphism
 - sex specific plasticity (how the body proportions of each sex respond to environmental changes)
 - fertility
 - minimum viable weight (mass at which 50% of the population reaches adulthood)
 - developmental timing
 - senecance (when death occurs as a result of aging)

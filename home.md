# About Me
I am an Ecology and Evolution PhD candidate in the Shingleton lab. My work focuses on the size difference between the sexes, known as sexual size dimorphism. I use _Drosophila melanogaster_ (the common fruit fly) as my model organism. I am also a very proud parent to a toddler. I will complete my degree in 2026. 

# Teaching 
I used to TA as a lab instructor for
  - BIOS120: Biology of Populations and Communities
  - BIOS310: Genetics
 
# Advisees 

My work would not have been possible without my undergraduate lab aides! The most notable of which are:

 - Jannie Diaz
 - Anna Ford
 - Austin Kim
 - Nina Laliwala
 - Katie Shultz

# About me 
I grew up in Brooklyn, and I have a child with my spouse. We often stroll through the neighborhood foraging for fruits and logging them on [Falling Fruit](https://fallingfruit.org/). I have recently started getting into knitting and I am impressed by the two by two technique, though I cannot seem to get past my first row.

I am best reached by email, at **agoll3@uic.edu**.
